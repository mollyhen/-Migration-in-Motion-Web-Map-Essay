<h3> Introduction </h3>

The goal of the map was to help scientists and the public see the changing habitat locations of thousands of vertebrates due to climate change. The predicted corridors for animal travel can then be used a reference for scientists and public figures to enact change and change construction methods to ensure these corridors are not completing blocked for the animals. The more the human landscape inhibits the travel of animals the more animals that will die from climate change because they are not able to travel to the new region with their needed climate for survival. As determined by examining the web map we are able to determine there are large migrations of animals from the South East of the United States to towards the North East. There are also multiple large migrations leaving the Brazil region. From the northern part of Brazil, a large migration is moving West out of the country. Another migration of a large number of animals from Southern Brazil is focused on moving South East closer to the coast of South America. A function of the map was to determine corridors with a large influx of animal migration. These three areas that from visually analyzing map seem to have the largest migrations that are predicted to occur. These areas need to be a focus for reform and transition from a human made environment that is almost impossible for animals to migrate through because of the fragmentation of the land from human construction. Humans need to begin preserving areas and routes that animals would be able to use in their effort to find a new habitat because climate change forced them to migrate. The target audience for this type of research is for scientists specifically those doing climate and animal research. Scientists are able to use these findings to support their research in the effects of climate change on animal migrations. Furthering the research and evidence that these events will occur scientists can help persuade change in the government to support city designs that conserve habitats that will be needed for animals that will be migrating to their areas to find a new suitable habitat. Also, convincing government and city designers to create human made features that decrease the fragmentation of the environment, which we are building upon. Fragmentation of habitat from human-made features could be the end for many vertebrates that will be migrating from increased temperatures in their current unhospitable habitats. Climate change will alter the ecosystems around the world and to be able to adapt and survive animals need to migrate. Humans can either help or hinder this inevitable event by maintaining connectivity between the environment's human made features fragment.
